What is Linux? 🐧

Linux is an Operating System (OS)

Just like Windows or macOS, it manages hardware and software resources.

It provides a way for users and applications to interact with the computer.

Built on UNIX principles

Linux is a free, open-source alternative to the older UNIX systems.

It follows the same philosophy of being stable, secure, and multi-user.

Open Source 🔓

The source code is free to view, modify, and distribute.

This has allowed communities worldwide to improve and adapt it.
