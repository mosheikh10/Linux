# What is Linux? 🐧

Linux is an Operating System (OS)
 - Just like Windows or macOS, it manages hardware and software resources.
 - It provides a way for users and applications to interact with the computer.

Built on UNIX principles
 - Linux is a free, open-source alternative to the older UNIX systems.
 - It follows the same philosophy of being stable, secure, and multi-user.

Open Source 🔓
 - The source code is free to view, modify, and distribute.
 - This has allowed communities worldwide to improve and adapt it.

Where Linux is Used
 - Servers 🌐: Most web servers run Linux (e.g., Google, Facebook, Amazon).
 - Desktops/Laptops 💻: Ubuntu, Fedora, and Mint are popular user-friendly distros. I'll be using Ubuntu.
 - Embedded Systems 📱: Phones (Android is based on Linux), smart TVs, routers, cars.

Why Linux?
