# 💻 The Linux Shell

🐚 What is the Shell?
 - The shell is a program that takes your commands and tells the operating system what to do.
 - It’s basically the “command-line interface” for interacting with Linux.
 - Unlike a graphical desktop, the shell uses text commands. So we have to tell it what to do.

🔑 Common Shells
 - Bash (Bourne Again Shell) – most common and default on many Linux systems.
 - Zsh – more customizable, with themes and plugins.
 - Fish – user-friendly, with built-in suggestions and syntax highlighting.

🖥️ Why Use the Shell?
 - Greater control over the system.
 - Faster for certain tasks compared to a GUI.
 - Essential for servers (which often don’t have a graphical desktop).

🛠️ Basic Commands in the Shell
 - pwd → shows your current directory.
 - ls → lists files in the current directory.
 - cd foldername → move into a directory.
 - man command → opens the manual for a command.
 - clear → clears the screen.
