# Linux 🐧🚀
This repository is dedicated to documenting my path in learning the Fundamentals of Linux. It serves as my personal study hub, where I break down concepts and commands into clear notes, while also practicing through hands-on challenges

# What’s Inside 📂
Step-by-step notes covering key Linux topics such as:
- Navigating the filesystem with basic commands
- File and directory management
- Useful shortcuts and tricks I’ve picked up along the way

# 🎮 Practical Challenges
I’ll also be tackling interactive Linux challenges like the OverTheWire Bandit Game, documenting solutions, thought processes, and lessons learned as I go.

# 📔 Personal Reference Guide
Think of this as my custom Linux handbook. A quick place for me to revisit commands and concepts I’ve already learned, and a helpful resource for anyone just starting out.
