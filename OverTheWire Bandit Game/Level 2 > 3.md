# Level 2 > 3

# Aim
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `spaces in this filename` located in the home directory.

# Solution
 - cat "spaces in this filename"
 - The file name contains spaces, so we wrap it in double quotes (" ") to ensure the shell interprets it as a single argument.
